# KnLiveDbg kmon Test Target

`KnLiveDbgKmonTarget.exe` is a lab-only positive-control process for `!kmon`
user-mode hostility. It creates artifacts inside copies of **this** binary. It
does not inject into a third-party process, does not resume a replaced image,
and does not unlink processes from the kernel.

DKOM hide classification is covered by the existing `hidden-process-view-classification`
console self-test, not by this harness.

## Build

```powershell
.\tools\build.ps1 -Configuration Release
```

Build the solution (`kn-live-dbg.sln`), not the vcxproj alone. The solution
`OutDir` is:

```text
x64\Release\tools\KnLiveDbgKmonTarget.exe
```

A direct vcxproj build lands under `kmon_test_target\x64\Release\tools\` and
will miss the console self-test lookup next to `KnLiveDbg.exe`.

## Scenarios

Parent modes use `%TEMP%\kn-live-dbg-kmon\ordinary-kmon-target.exe`.
Only `/masquerade` uses `notepad.exe`, because its purpose is to exercise a
Windows-name/path mismatch. Watched main-image verification is independent of
the filename. Sequential runs retry `DeleteFile` + `CopyFile` while a previous
fixture copy is in use. `/seconds N` holds the artifact (default 45), and
`/seconds 0` holds until termination. Children use `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`.

`/replace-main` unmaps only at the original ImageBase, allocates the private
replacement at that same base, and does not resume the process. If
`VirtualAllocEx` cannot land at the original ImageBase, the scenario fails
instead of leaving PEB ImageBase unmapped.

| Flag | Artifact | Expected `process.hollow` / related layer |
|---|---|---|
| `/masquerade` | temp `notepad.exe` copy, no memory patch | `process.masquerade` |
| `/overwrite` | NOP patch on own `.text` (`0x90` sled over the section head, `kOverwritePatchBytes`), RX restored | `finding.code_modified`; COW is `coverage.image_cow` |
| `/stamp` | in-memory `TimeDateStamp` rewritten | `hollow` |
| `/nomz` | ImageBase MZ wiped | `exe_no_mz` |
| `/orphan-private` | `VirtualAlloc` RX page with MZ | `exe_orphan_private` |
| `/orphan-image` | delete-pending `SEC_IMAGE` map, not in the loader | `exe_orphan_image` |
| `/orphan-mapped-rx` | anonymous headerless `MEM_MAPPED` section with inert RX bytes, never executed | `mapped_exec` on an explicitly watched copy; no execution is inferred |
| `/mapped-readonly` | same section bytes with `PAGE_READONLY` | no executable-orphan finding (negative control) |
| `/replace-main` | suspended self-copy, EXE unmapped, private MZ, **never resumed** | `exe_private` |
| `/ghost` | running copy then delete the file | `ghost` |

`/ghost` needs `GetFileAttributesW` to fail with file/path not found. Access
denied remains a coverage gap. A delete-pending file
that is still visible is not `layer=ghost`; the fixture prints a warning in
that case.

`/orphan-image` still fires through its RX text sub-region. The orphan image
layer requires an executable region at the allocation base, so read-only
`LoadLibraryEx(LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_IMAGE_RESOURCE)` views left by icon/version
readers (single orphan `MEM_IMAGE` + `PAGE_READONLY` region) stay silent.
The fixture opens its own backing file with execute access before creating
`SEC_IMAGE`; omitting that access produces `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`. It also
requires a complete write and successful delete-pending disposition before
mapping. Its minimal PE has a valid `.text` entry RVA and is never executed.

Stdout line:

```text
KMON_FIXTURE pid=<pid> scenario=<name> image=<path>
```

PID is also written to `%TEMP%\kn-live-dbg-kmon\artifact.pid`. Every mode prints that line and writes that pid file; `/overwrite` announces before its destructive step because the `0x90` sled lands on the code that emits them, so a `/child overwrite` run still leaves the documented readiness signal.

`/seconds` accepts decimal values from 0 through 4,294,967. Zero explicitly
requests an indefinite hold. Missing, malformed, negative, or larger values
fail before copying or modifying the fixture; milliseconds cannot wrap.

## Live `!kmon` pass

Elevated, driver loaded:

```text
write on
!kmon /name ordinary-kmon-target.exe /background
```

Other console:

```powershell
.\x64\Release\tools\KnLiveDbgKmonTarget.exe /overwrite /seconds 60
```

Then `!kmon` to attach the tail. Bounded user/image scans rotate through
targets; use `!kmon status` to inspect progress and overdue work. Repeat with `/stamp`, `/nomz`, `/orphan-private`,
`/orphan-image`, `/orphan-mapped-rx`, `/mapped-readonly`, `/replace-main`, `/ghost`, `/masquerade`.

`/replace-main` leaves a suspended process; the fixture terminates it when the
hold expires.

`add` / `remove` only work after collection is already running. `/verbose` and
`/log` apply only on the first start.

## Automated primitives

`KnLiveDbg.exe --self-test console` includes `kmon-artifact-primitives`:

1. A write to self `.text` makes `QueryWorkingSetEx` Shared=0 (`exe_cow`), then
   bytes are restored.
2. A private MZ page is `MEM_PRIVATE`.
3. `GetMappedFileNameW` returns a path for the current EXE mapping.
4. If the fixture EXE is next to `KnLiveDbg.exe` (or under `tools\`), a
   `/child overwrite` process shows private COW pages. The parent observes
   the sled in the child image before it judges the mapping, and the
   observed length comes from the fixture shared contract
   (`kmon_test_target/KmonTestTargetContract.h`) instead of a second
   hard-coded copy: a sled shorter than the contract fails this case rather
   than silently skipping the comparison.
5. When the fixture binary or process creation is unavailable the
   cross-process half is skipped with one explicit reason line naming which
   of the six conditions applied (fixture missing, `CreateProcessW` failed,
   `OpenProcess` refused, PEB ImageBase unreadable, contract sled never
   observed, child exited before the COW sample).

That gate does not require `write on` or `!kmon`. The standalone
`tools/validate-kmon-core.ps1` also compares an executable page in its own
ordinary-name EXE against the relocation-aware disk reference, changes a byte
in the middle of its second executable probe page, verifies the mismatch,
and restores it. See [verification and manifest usage](KMON_DETECTION_VERIFICATION.md)
for queue, short-lived capture, native PDB and mapping-reuse controls.

The independent `kmon-mapped-section-artifact` console gate creates a real
anonymous section, verifies `MEM_MAPPED` plus executable protection and readable
sample bytes with the production candidate helpers, changes it to read-only,
and verifies rejection. The bytes are never executed. This gate does not depend
on a process-name alias or on loading the driver.

`kmon-user-memory-regression` checks independent kernel-section identity,
unreadable samples, ghost/path failure distinctions, CoW page selection,
bounded process scheduling, and live thread-start query primitives. Neither
this gate nor launching a fixture proves that a running `!kmon` emitted an
event; that requires the live pass above.

## Not covered here

- Live DKOM `ActiveProcessLinks` unlink (needs a kernel fixture).
- Cross-process injection into a real inbox `notepad.exe` / `svchost.exe`.
- Game + anti-cheat idle FP soak (manual on the game machine).
- Kernel mapper / pool PE / unbacked hook positives (those stay on `!pool pe`,
  `!kpage`, `!mapper`, `!callbacks`).

The implemented observations, current research, and remaining gaps are listed
in [KMON_DETECTION_COVERAGE.md](https://github.com/kernullist/kn-live-dbg/blob/v0.0.35/docs/KMON_DETECTION_COVERAGE.md).
